# GitHub Profile/Repository Page

The site is hosted at  [githubprofile.lekeodewuyi.com](https://githubprofile.lekeodewuyi.com)


A recreation of my GitHub profile page. It loads live data from the GitHub GraphQL API - the first 20 repositories sorted by the last updated(desc order) property.

It is designed to look exactly like the GitHub repository tab. The links in the listed repository are active - clicking a repository name will go to such repository or and clicking a forked repository's parent link (Forked from...<link>) will go the corresponding parent repository.

It is responsive just like the real GitHub repository page.

Even though it loads my profile/repository data by default, it can load any user's data when their username is entered.

To access the prompt to enter a username, simply click on any avatar(profile image) on the page or double-click anywhere on the page.

All functions are written in Vanilla JS - including the function to evaluate relative time.
