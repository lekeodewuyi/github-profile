# GitHub Profile - Repository Tab

A recreation of my GitHub profile page. It loads live data from the GitHub GraphQL API.

Even though it loads my data by default, it can load any user's data when their username is entered.

To access the prompt to enter a username, simply click on any avatar(profile image) on the page or double-click anywhere on the page.

The site is hosted at  [githubprofile.lekeodewuyi.com](https://githubprofile.lekeodewuyi.com)
